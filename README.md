# Binary Classification Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on binary classification. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that classifies data into two categories based on key features.

## Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions, correlations, and class balance  
- Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical data  
- Model Training: Implementing logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks  
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/binary-classifier-project.git
   cd binary-classifier-project
